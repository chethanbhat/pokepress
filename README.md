# Pokepress WordPress Theme

A small project to create a custom WordPress theme using custom post type (Pokemon) and custom taxonomy (Pokemon Types)

The theme consists of a script which makes api request to [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) and stores that data into WordPress using Advance Custom Fields.

Different Pokemon types such as fire, grass etc are stored as custom taxonomies and they can be viewed using their archive pages.

You can search for your favorite pokemon using AJAX live search built with vanilla JavaScript.

All the pages are paginated as per the pokemon data.

## Key features of the Project

- Custom Post Type
- Custom Taxonomy
- Custom WordPress Theme
- Ajax Live Search
- Pagination
